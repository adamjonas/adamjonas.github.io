For a sixth year running, regular Bitcoin Core contributors received a survey to surface priorities and ensure that people feel that they can contribute effectively. Below is a summary of the results in a format similar to previous years' surveys.

## 2024 Activity

Last year...

- 1622 PRs were opened against the master branch (compared to 1553 PRs in 2023, 1923 PRs in 2022, 1948 PRs in 2021, 2066 PRs in 2020, 1890 PRs in 2019, 2008 PRs in 2018, 1778 PRs in 2017)
- ... 1125 PRs were merged against master (1093 PRs in 2023, 1296 PRs in 2022, 1406 PRs in 2021, 1416 PRs in 2020, 1226 PRs in 2019, 1254 PRs in 2018, 1161 PRs in 2017)

*A regular reviewer must have left >= 100 comments

## The Questions

The questionnaire consisted of 14 questions, which included:

- How happy were you with progress in Bitcoin Core in 2024? (score 1-5 with comment. 1 = unhappy, 5 = happy)
- How happy were you with your own contributions? (score 1-5 with comment. 1 = unhappy, 5 = happy)
- What went well in 2024?
- Is there anything that frustrated or disappointed you about the Bitcoin Core project or your own contributions in 2024?
- What do you hope will happen in Bitcoin Core in 2025?
- What do you personally hope to achieve with Bitcoin Core in 2025?
- Is there anything you'd change about the process/project that would help those things happen?
- What one thing would make you happier or more productive working on Bitcoin Core?
- How connected do you feel to the other contributors of the project?
- Would you be willing to mentor another contributor?
- What aspect of Bitcoin or Bitcoin Core would you like to learn more about?
- What topics would you like to discuss at the next CoreDev event?

## The responses

### Review Process Challenges

The frustrations around review could be broken down into a few buckets:

#### Review Availability and Pace +10

Contributors consistently highlighted the gap between available review capacity and project needs. As one contributor noted, "Overall I'm quite happy about the past year with my contributions, though PRs taking a long time to get reviewed and merged can sometimes be frustrating... this is a direct result of the 'we need more review power' problem." Another observed that while "the pace of the project has improved... still there is a lack of reviewers."

#### Review Depth vs. Breadth +3

Several contributors highlighted the tension between review quantity and quality. One reviewer noted their struggle: "I ended up having to spend a good amount of time in understanding the context due to which I had to limit myself reviewing smaller PRs. But now I want to be able to review bigger, meatier PRs." This reflects a broader challenge of balancing thorough, in-depth reviews with the need to maintain review velocity.

#### Priority and Communication +4

A recurring theme was the need for better communication around review priorities. Contributors expressed frustration when working on projects that seemed to have broad conceptual support but couldn't gather sufficient review attention. As one contributor explained: "It's a bit frustrating when everyone agrees that the project you're pushing forward is a good idea, but after spending some time working on it, you realize there is no review power to make it happen."

#### Feedback Quality +2

The survey revealed nuanced challenges around review feedback. There were concerns about the balance between constructive criticism and maintaining momentum, with one contributor noting: "When providing scepticism in review comments, some weren't received well... While at the same time people were asking for more NACKs, I see that it is a thin line I am balancing on."

## Special thanks

Thanks to Mike Schmidt for resurrecting [Bitcoin Core stats](https://github.com/bitschmidty/bitcoin-core-contributor-stats), which I used to pull the numbers for this report.

## Till next year...

Thank you to all 37 contributors who took the time to respond to this survey. I look forward to reporting on a similar survey in early 2026.
