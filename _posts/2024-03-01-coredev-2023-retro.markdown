For a fifth year running, regular Bitcoin Core contributors received a survey to surface priorities and ensure that people feel that they can contribute effectively. Below is a summary of the results in a format similar to [last year's survey](/bitcoin/coredev/retro/coredev-2022-retro/).

## 2023 Activity

- 1323 PRs were opened against the master branch (compared to 1712 PRs in 2022, 1785 PRs in 2021, 1928 PRs in 2020, 1789 in 2019, 1910 in 2018, 1716 in 2017)
- ... 843 PRs were merged against master (1091 PRs in 2022, 1261 PRs in 2021, 1257 PRs in 2020, 1167 2019, 1244 in 2018, 1152 in 2017)

\*A regular reviewer must have left >= 5 comments

## The Questions

The questionnaire consisted of 13 questions, which included:

- How happy were you with progress in Bitcoin Core in 2023? (score 1-5 with comment. 1 = unhappy, 5 = happy). Try to think about what your hopes for this year were at the start of the year and whether that happened.
- How happy were you with your own contributions? (score 1-5 with comment. 1 = unhappy, 5 = happy). Again, try to think about what you were hoping to achieve at the beginning of the year and whether that happened.
- What went well in 2023? This can be about the project or process or your individual achievements.
- Is there anything that frustrated or disappointed you about the Bitcoin Core project or your own contributions in 2023?
- What do you hope will happen in Bitcoin Core in 2024? Try to rank your priorities.
- What do you personally hope to achieve with Bitcoin Core in 2024? Try to rank your priorities.
- Is there anything youâ€™d change about the process/project that would help those things happen?
- What is one thing that would make you happier or more productive?
- How connected do you feel to the other contributors of the project? Do you have any ideas on how to better sync with them?
- Would you be willing to mentor another contributor? (Mentoring can mean a lot of different things, this is a rough way to gauge interest)
- What aspect of Bitcoin or Bitcoin Core would you like to learn more about?
- What topics would you like to discuss at the next CoreDev event?
- Anything else?

## Priority Projects

19 of the 25 respondents made specific references to priority projects:

- "Introducing the concept of priority projects made the whole development process more organized and focussed and is helpful both for newcomers and long-term contributors to answer the question 'where is my time best spent for helping out in reviewing/testing etc.?'"
- "The priority project initiative started out quite strong and I think it did fairly well."
- "Priority projects are great!"
- "I think the process of picking high priority projects... checking in with them every week was a great idea."
- "[Liked the] idea of priority projects! really liked the direction, flexibility and pace priority projects brought to Bitcoin Core."
- "One of last years points... was 'having a list of "what has to be done" sorted by priority would be nice', which was actually fulfilled with the priority projects. Nice!"

There were some outstanding questions about priority projects as well:
- "Clearer expectations about what priority project champions should be doing."
- "First round of priority projects went well; not sure we were setup for success for the second round."
- "Focus on high-priority projects worked well in some cases - but unclear if that was really due to the changed process and if it's a one-time-thing or if it would work sustainably."

## By the numbers

Project satisfaction numbers rose to their highest numbers since the survey. However, contribution numbers are down across the board.

Priority projects were frequently mentioned as having helped improve the enjoyment of working on the project, however, Bitcoin Core is not attracting new members to replace long-time contributors who have stepped away.

## Reviewing comments about review

Consistent with past surveys, review was a central theme but there was less mention in this survey than in [past surveys](/bitcoin/coredev/retro/coredev-2022-retro/#review). Maybe this is because a lot of that discussion shifted to talking about the project priorities.

## The maintainers

This year's survey also had a couple of specific requests for the maintainers:

1. I think it would be helpful to have some guidelines on when PRs should be closed and how aggressively the maintainers should moderate discussion on controversial PRs and issues.
2. "I would appreciate clear feedback from maintainers and more experienced collaborators. Pull requests that are not likely going to be merged should be communicated to the contributor explicitly, along with the reasons, and they should be closed to avoid unnecessary rebases."

## Till next year...

Thank you to the contributors who took the time to respond to this survey. I look forward to reporting on a similar survey in early 2025.
