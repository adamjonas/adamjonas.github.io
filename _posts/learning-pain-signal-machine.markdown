Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) have failed to change the world because content isn't the most important aspect to education. It's a bottleneck for sure, but it's just one ingredient. Learning in isolation is hard. Take away the status roles that motivate most of our lives and you are left with a heavy dependence on content to make the linkages that we so naturally can extract from a short conversation. Content provides us an arena to gather, but a good education meets the learner where they are at the time they need it. It's an inspirational talk when the learner lacks enthuiasm. It's empathy when a learner feels lost. It's clarity when a learner feels confused. This was impossible with a book and still difficult with hyperlinks, but it's natural with a group that is sharing in the pain of learning together.

## Learning is pain

The mind is designed to be resistant to change. Every night we grow and strengthen the neural pathways from the previous day and shed or let atrophy pathways no longer deemed relevant. As a child new pathways are easy to make, after 25 this becomes much more difficult and so most adult brains are either strengthening or letting atrophy connections that already exist. And so, learning as an adult is painful.

That's the science, now my observations of working with learners. There is a certainly type of person that is willing to put themselves through this pain. Most capitulate or pull back. But there are a few that are comfortable dropping themselves into the fog of learning something completly foreign. They get discouraged like the rest of us but they are willing to be vulnerable to acquire the knowledge or skill they are after. We are all somewhere on this sprectrum, of course, but a cohort of people that embrace the pain is my dream scenario.

## Creating signal

I don't know how to capture the act of humans pushing through the pain of learning except to have them do it and observe it myself. You know it when you see it. Completion isn't a terrible metric. It demonstrates the grit to go all the way through. But what I'm describing isn't quite grit because grit can also be something like obiedience. I'm not looking for rule followers. I'm looking for people who do the minimum to learn the thing and move on. I've heard these people called "lazy" but they are just good at conserving their time and energy so that they can go after bigger things.

## The signal machine

We need a machine that you can dump a bunch of people into that creates signal of where they are and their pain threshold. We need an army of people that "know it when they see it" and we need pathing for people that have got the goods.

### Major League Baseball as a casetudy

Players are drawn to programs with a track record of training talented players. These programs are motivated to seek out talented players to help them win immediately but also to attach themselves to their legacy and benefit from the "halo effect" based on their success.

Scouts are employed to evaluate players and their continued employment is (or at least should be) tied to their record.

This isn't quite a meritocracy because most evaluations are risk-adverse and therefore, unorthodox talent from unorthodox places isn't valued in the same way, but the incentives are aligned to "discover" talent.

Once talent is in the professional system, they must prove their worth by a battle of attrition through the unglamorous minor leagues. These include 15 hour bus rides, below minimum wage pay, and boredom. However, all Major League teams are incentivized to create value out of the players in their organization and so they invest in their development.

Signal is derived by coaches by spending nearly every waking hour together. Outside observers, scouts, create an outsiders' evaluation of players' skill on the field. Front office administrators digest this information and make personnel moves accordingly. If a player advances through the ranks to arrive at the Major Leagues, the investment, financial or otherwise, increases exponentially. It's an arbitrary threshold and is dependent on factors players don't control like which organzization they belong to, the talent within the organzation at the position they play, payroll factors and more.

## Bitcoin scouts

Their is a prestige associated with baseball scouts. It's a wildly unglamorous job. It's a life of 180 nights a year in hotels. They are rarely celebrated. The pay isn't great. People do some nutty things for prestige.
