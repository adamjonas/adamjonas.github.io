# Bitcoin Core is different

In an age of moving fast and breaking things, Bitcoin Core is an increasingly rare kind of project that resists the urge to speed up.

## Why Bitcoin education

I work on education because it's _the_ [archemedies lever](). I've seen enough talented programmers at work to convince me I don't have what it takes. But with that knowledge of what talent looks like, I can do some good. When I worked in baseball, they used to refer to to exceptional talent as "it." As in, they've got "it" or they don't.

## Thoughts on 'bitcoin toxicity'

I've invested some time in trying to understand those that pride themselves as toxic to understand their perspective. I appreciate that there are differing priorities and I understand the value of sticking to a strict ethos can reinforce enduring cultural norms. The argument, however, cuts both ways. You don't want me to force my priorities on you and I don't want you to force your priorites on me. And so, I take issue with the [messaging] that while designed to repel scams and message bitcoin's unique qualities also repels new contributors and messages that "you don't belong to our clique."

From a recruiting standpoint, the main issue is that half of all the promosing prospects I meet [believe they don't belong already](imposter syndrome). Driving people off with a, "you don't belong" narrative isn't trial by fire. It is unnesccesarily pushing skilled devs away that we desperately need. Because if you think Bitcoin Core devs grow on trees, then you haven't spent time in the project. We lost BlueMatt and GMax and we could [easily lose more](wlad tweet). These people aren't soft or weak. They are tired. And when they leave, with them goes ~30 years of context that you can't instantly find elsewhere. Bitcoin Core is a tough project. The residency and the educational onramps that I work on are designed to find reinforcements, but you don't win a war by throwing a bunch of untrained n00bs out into battle. Quantity helps, but only with a variety of experienced generals guiding and training them.

## Learning Requires Enlistment

Learning complex things is hard. Bitcoin Core is an elevan year old code base based on a prototype. The first rule of building a legitimate product is that you don't put your prototype into production but write it properly once you've got something hacky working. That's not happened here and it shows. Some of [biggest historical efforts](break up main.cpp) has been untangling the original choices that Satoshi made to get something working out into the world. That's all to say that it takes an enormous investment to understand all of the warts and imperfections of Bitcoin Core. It takes energy to aptitude and dedication to make real progress. And that takes patience. Or as some Bitcoiners might call it, a low time preference.

On that journey, not everyone is going to have a good day every day. There will be peaks, but in the beginning it's mostly valleys. It's a long march.

## Bitcoin != Bitcoin Twitter

So it's really hard to watch those dedciated few that are willing to march get beat up online. Twitter is designed to encourage conflict and belligerant personalities. It amplifies that loudest and most extreme voices. What is worse, is that this is Bitcoin's main advertising medium and as someone who talks to talented devs deciding how much of their time to invest in Bitcoin versus other projects, we are losing. We are losing badly.

But come to other parts of publically accessible [Bitcoin forums](https://meetup.com/bitdevsnyc) and you will find a very different group. One that is welcoming and encouraging. One that has weathered bulls and bears together. What's great about bitcoin is that it's not one thing or one group. There are technical, social, economic, ethical, and cultural aspects to it that can keep you engaged for a lifetime. It's no mistake that you hear it referred to as a rabbit hole. The learning never ends.

## Ways to Learn

There are a few ways to onramp a bunch of devs.
1. Onboard en masse through MOOCs or giant classes. 98% of the candidates will not complete it, but for the 2% that do, you know they've got "it." The pros of this is that it's universally accessible. There are no admissions criteria. Anyone with an internet connection has a fair chance. The cons are that it's not very fun and there are lots of people that likely have "it" but not the reclusive personality to study in isolation. This scales but leaks a lot of candidates you'd prefer to keep around. The key is to make it hard enough actually teach something and convey rigor, but not drive too many candidates away that don't want to watch a bunch of videos or read the equivalent of an online book by themselves. This is the equivalent of presuming everyone with a pair of running shoes will get themselves into shape. A few will actually do it.
2. Personal tutors. There is a dearth of Bitcoin Core mentors. Intuitively we know that's a shortcoming, but the hidden downside is that the mentors that do exist have a disproportionate influence on how newcomers act and how they prioritize their work. There is no manual on how to act as a contributor ([this is as close](CONTRIBUTING.md) as we've got)) or how to choose what to work on. However, you might feel about the value of Diversity, inculcating a subset of behavioral norms and a particular set of values amongst newcomers has second order effects that may take a while to play out.
3. You could combine these approaches. Require some work upfront incentivized by the social pressure of the fact you aren't doing it alone. In an ideal world, the cohort carries each individual forward on a journey together reinforced by authentic support. These shared experiences tap into something deep inside us about support and connection to our cause and our fellow companions. It's why bootcamp works to indoctrinate an ethos and bond soliders. It's why PeaceMany of us never get to experience it, but s Then continue to "promote" prospects by giving them more personalized attention before eventually assigning them to a personal mentor. This is the holy grail and though my previously career was in online coding education, I'm not conceided enough to think I'm going to nail this any time soon.



notes: 
Ugh. Twitter. I've blocked it off on my phone. Added it to my [host block list] on my work computer. But still it comes for me. Looking at Twitter once a day is still too much for me because I've lost count of how many times it makes me feel upset or depressed and can count the times it's made me feel uplifted or enthused. But for the new contributors I'm hoping to find, this is Bitcoin's advertising medium and as someone who talks to talented devs deciding how much of their time to invest in Bitcoin versus "other" projects, we are losing. We are losing badly.

Nyms make sense when you are fighting a totalitarian regime. But using a nym to make someone feel bad about themselves isn't fair. If you are tough enough to call someone a "disease of humanity," have the courage to at least put your name on it.

(I get this is an example of a hierarchy rather than the flat governance of open source, but if you think all code or ACKs are equal, then you've also not spent time in the project.)

open source is hierarchical


# On Contributor Lonliness

I've talked to a lot of Bitcoin open-source contributors lately about their progress and level of statisfaction.  As the quarantine marches onfeel isolated and alone. While many dream about making a living on open-source, I've seen many devs that feel like they lack the feedback and guard rails of a more traditional job. In absence of that, I thought I'd share some patterns I see from people when they are at their best.
